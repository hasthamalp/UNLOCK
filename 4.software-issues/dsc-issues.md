# DSC Issues



Right-click on the Rubix cube and select Settings and select the correct dsc token (proxkey / epass - if epass is the custom token)

* For epass, select custom). Then click on the browse file below.
* C: \ Windows \ System32 \\
*
  * Select eps2003csp11V2.dll and save. That is my computer - c drive - windows - system 32 folder. In it, select eps2003csp11V2.dll. Then save. Just save to Proxkey.
* When you save it you will be asked to re-insert the token and when it is done the dsc token and signer will be set up.
